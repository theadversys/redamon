## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & Docker Compose v2+

That's it. No Node.js, Python, or security tools needed on your host.

### 1. Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samugit83/redamon.git
cd redamon
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add at least one AI provider key:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # recommended
# or
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
```
Get your key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) or [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

**Optional keys** (add these for extra capabilities):
```env
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...        # Web search for the AI agent — get one at tavily.com
NVD_API_KEY=...                # NIST NVD API — higher rate limits for CVE lookups — nist.gov/developers
```

### 2. Build & Start

```bash
# Build all images (including recon scanner)
docker compose --profile tools build

# Start all services
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Open the Webapp

Go to **http://localhost:3000** — create a project, configure your target, and start scanning.

### Services

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Webapp** | http://localhost:3000 | Next.js dashboard, graph visualization, Agent Zero iframe |

docker compose logs -f agent                # Legacy AI agent
docker compose logs -f recon-orchestrator   # Recon orchestrator
docker compose logs -f kali-sandbox         # MCP tool servers (naabu, nuclei, etc.)
docker compose logs -f neo4j                # Neo4j graph database
docker compose logs -f postgres             # PostgreSQL database

# Full cleanup: remove all containers, images, and volumes
docker compose --profile tools down --rmi local --volumes --remove-orphans
```

### Running Reconnaissance

**Option A: From Webapp (Recommended)**
1. Create a project with target domain and settings
2. Navigate to Graph page
3. Click "Start Recon" button
4. Watch real-time logs in the drawer

**Option B: From CLI**
```bash
cd recon
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm recon python /app/recon/main.py
```

### Development Mode

For active development with **Next.js fast refresh** (no rebuild on every change):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

This swaps the production webapp image for a dev container with your source code volume-mounted. Every file save triggers instant hot-reload in the browser.

**Refreshing Python services after code changes:**

The Python services (`agent`, `recon-orchestrator`, `kali-sandbox`) already have their source code volume-mounted, so files are synced live. However, the running Python process won't pick up changes until you restart the container:

```bash
# Restart a single service (picks up code changes instantly)
docker compose restart agent              # AI agent orchestrator
docker compose restart recon-orchestrator  # Recon orchestrator
docker compose restart kali-sandbox       # MCP tool servers
```

No rebuild needed — just restart.

## Overview

PandaExploit is a modular, containerized penetration testing framework that chains automated reconnaissance, AI-driven exploitation, and graph-powered intelligence into a single, end-to-end offensive security pipeline. Every component runs inside Docker — no tools installed on your host — and communicates through well-defined APIs so each layer can evolve independently.

The platform is built around four pillars:

| Pillar | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent Zero (Main Orchestrator)** | An autonomous AI agent that drives the entire platform. It uses MCP tools to run scans (nmap, nuclei, nikto, sqlmap), ingests findings into the graph, queries the graph for intelligence, chains attacks, and operates with minimal human intervention. Embedded in the webapp via iframe. |
| **Reconnaissance Pipeline** | Six sequential scanning phases that map your target's entire attack surface — from subdomain discovery to vulnerability detection — and store the results as a rich, queryable graph. Can be started by Agent Zero or manually from the webapp. |
| **Attack Surface Graph** | A Neo4j knowledge graph with 17 node types and 20+ relationship types that serves as the single source of truth for every finding — and the primary data source Agent Zero queries before every decision. |
| **Project Settings Engine** | 180+ per-project parameters — exposed through the webapp UI — that control every tool's behavior, from Naabu thread counts to Nuclei severity filters to agent approval gates. |

---

### Reconnaissance Pipeline

The recon pipeline is a fully automated, six-phase scanning engine that runs inside a Kali Linux container. Given a single root domain (or a specific subdomain list), it progressively builds a complete picture of the target's external attack surface. Each phase feeds its output into the next, and the final result is both a structured JSON file and a populated Neo4j graph.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/recon.gif" alt="PandaExploit Reconnaissance Pipeline" width="100%"/>
</p>

#### Phase 1 — Domain Discovery

The pipeline starts by mapping the target's subdomain landscape using three complementary techniques:

- **Certificate Transparency** via crt.sh — queries the public CT logs to find every certificate ever issued for the root domain, extracting subdomain names from Subject and SAN fields.
- **HackerTarget API** — a passive lookup that returns known subdomains without sending any traffic to the target.
- **Knockpy** (optional brute-force) — an active subdomain bruteforcer that tests thousands of common prefixes against the target's DNS. Controlled by the `useBruteforceForSubdomains` toggle.
- **WHOIS Lookup** — retrieves registrar, registrant, creation/expiration dates, name servers, and contact information with automatic retry logic and exponential backoff.
- **DNS Resolution** — resolves every discovered subdomain to its A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME, and SOA records, building a map of IP addresses and mail infrastructure.

When a specific `subdomainList` is provided (e.g., `www.`, `api.`, `mail.`), the pipeline skips active discovery and only resolves the specified subdomains — useful for focused assessments.

#### Phase 2 — Port Scanning

All resolved IP addresses are fed into **Naabu**, a fast SYN/CONNECT port scanner. Key capabilities:

- **SYN scanning** (default) with automatic fallback to CONNECT mode if raw sockets are unavailable.
- Top-N port selection (100, 1000, or custom port ranges).
- **CDN/WAF detection** — identifies Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront and other CDN providers, optionally excluding them from deeper scans.
- **Passive mode** — queries Shodan's InternetDB instead of sending packets, for zero-touch reconnaissance.
- **IANA service lookup** — maps port numbers to service names using the 15,000-entry IANA registry.

#### Phase 3 — HTTP Probing & Technology Detection

Every host+port combination is probed over HTTP/HTTPS using **httpx** to determine which services are live and what they run:

- **Response metadata** — status codes, content types, page titles, server headers, response times, word/line counts.
- **TLS inspection** — certificate subject, issuer, expiry, cipher suite, JARM fingerprint.
- **Technology fingerprinting** — a dual-engine approach:
  - httpx's built-in detection identifies major frameworks and servers.
  - **Wappalyzer** (6,000+ fingerprints, auto-updated from npm) performs a second pass on the response HTML, catching CMS plugins, JavaScript libraries, and analytics tools that httpx misses. The merge is fully automatic with configurable minimum confidence thresholds.
- **Banner grabbing** — for non-HTTP ports (SSH, FTP, SMTP, MySQL, Redis, etc.), raw socket connections extract service banners and version strings using protocol-specific probe strings.

#### Phase 4 — Resource Enumeration

Three tools run **in parallel** (via ThreadPoolExecutor) to discover every reachable endpoint on the live URLs:

- **Katana** — an active web crawler that follows links to a configurable depth, optionally rendering JavaScript to discover dynamic routes. Extracts forms, input fields, and query parameters.
- **GAU** (GetAllUrls) — a passive discovery tool that queries the Wayback Machine, Common Crawl, AlienVault OTX, and URLScan.io for historical URLs. Results are verified with httpx to filter out dead links, and HTTP methods are detected via OPTIONS probes.
- **Kiterunner** — an API-specific brute-forcer that tests wordlists of common API routes (REST, GraphQL) against each base URL, detecting allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).

Results are merged, deduplicated, and organized by base URL. Every endpoint is classified into categories (auth, file_access, api, dynamic, static, admin) and its parameters are typed (id, file, search, auth_param).

#### Phase 5 — Vulnerability Scanning

The discovered endpoints — especially those with query parameters — are fed into **Nuclei**, a template-based vulnerability scanner with 8,000+ community templates:

- **DAST mode** (active fuzzing) — injects XSS, SQLi, RCE, LFI, SSRF, and SSTI payloads into every discovered parameter. This catches vulnerabilities that signature-only scanning misses.
- **Severity filtering** — scan for critical, high, medium, and/or low findings.
- **Interactsh integration** — out-of-band detection for blind vulnerabilities (SSRF, XXE, blind SQLi) via callback servers.
- **CVE enrichment** — each finding is cross-referenced against the NVD (or Vulners) API for CVSS scores, descriptions, and references.
- **30+ custom security checks** — direct IP access, missing security headers (CSP, HSTS, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, COOP, CORP, COEP), TLS certificate expiry, DNS security (SPF, DMARC, DNSSEC, zone transfer), open services (Redis without auth, exposed Kubernetes API, SMTP open relay), insecure form actions, and missing rate limiting.

#### Phase 6 — MITRE Enrichment & GitHub Secret Hunting

- **MITRE CWE/CAPEC mapping** — every CVE found in Phase 5 is automatically enriched with its corresponding CWE weakness and CAPEC attack patterns, using an auto-updated database from the CVE2CAPEC repository (24-hour cache TTL).
- **GitHub Secret Hunting** *(under development)* — when configured with a GitHub token, will scan the target organization's repositories, gists, and commit history for leaked API keys, cloud credentials, database connection strings, and private keys using 40+ regex patterns and Shannon entropy analysis. This feature is currently being integrated into the pipeline and is not yet available in production.

#### Output

All results are combined into a single JSON file (`recon/output/recon_{PROJECT_ID}.json`) and simultaneously imported into the Neo4j graph database, creating a fully connected knowledge graph of the target's attack surface.

### Agent Zero — Main Orchestrator

**Agent Zero** is the primary AI orchestrator of PandaExploit. It runs as a standalone service (`agent0ai/agent-zero`) and is embedded in the webapp via iframe. Agent Zero connects to PandaExploit through MCP (Model Context Protocol):

- **PandaExploit MCP** (port 8011) — Platform API: list projects, get graph, get vulnerabilities, start recon, and **ingest** tool output into the graph.
- **Kali Sandbox MCPs** (ports 8000–8006) — Execute tools: naabu, curl, nuclei, metasploit, nikto, sqlmap, nmap.

Agent Zero uses the **PandaExploit skill** to know when to call `set_pandaexploit_context`, `get_graph`, `get_vulnerabilities`, and the `ingest_*` tools. After every scan, it ingests results so the graph stays up to date. It reasons about the attack surface, prioritizes high-impact findings, and chains reconnaissance → vulnerability scan → exploitation.

**Legacy AI Agent** — A LangGraph-based agent (port 8090) is also available for WebSocket chat and phase-based exploitation. Agent Zero is the recommended orchestrator for autonomous pentesting.

---

### AI Agent Orchestrator (Legacy)

The legacy AI agent is a **LangGraph-based autonomous system** that implements the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern. It operates in a loop — reason about the current state, select and execute a tool, analyze the results, repeat — until the objective is complete or the user stops it.

#### Three Execution Phases

The agent progresses through three distinct operational phases, each with different tool access and objectives:

**Informational Phase** — The default starting phase. The agent gathers intelligence by querying the Neo4j graph, running web searches for CVE details, performing HTTP requests with curl, and scanning ports with Naabu. No offensive tools are available. The agent analyzes the attack surface, identifies high-value targets, and builds a mental model of what's exploitable.

**Exploitation Phase** — When the agent identifies a viable attack path, it requests a phase transition. This requires **user approval** (configurable). Once approved, the agent gains access to the Metasploit console via MCP and can execute exploits. Two attack paths are supported:

- **CVE Exploit** — the agent searches for a matching Metasploit module, configures the payload (reverse shell or bind shell), sets target parameters, and fires the exploit. For statefull mode, it establishes a Meterpreter session; for stateless mode, it executes one-shot commands.
- **Brute Force Credential Guess** — the agent selects appropriate wordlists and attacks services like SSH, FTP, or MySQL, with configurable maximum attempts per wordlist.

When an exploit succeeds, the agent automatically creates an **Exploit node** in the Neo4j graph — recording the attack type, target IP, port, CVE IDs, Metasploit module used, payload, session ID, and any credentials discovered. This node is linked to the targeted IP, the exploited CVE, and the entry port, making every successful compromise a permanent, queryable part of the attack surface graph.

  <img src="assets/exploit.gif" alt="PandaExploit Exploitation Demo" width="100%"/>
</p>

**Post-Exploitation Phase** — After a successful exploit, the agent can optionally transition to post-exploitation (if enabled). In statefull mode (Meterpreter), it runs interactive commands — enumeration, lateral movement, data exfiltration. In stateless mode, it re-runs exploits with different command payloads. This phase also requires user approval.

#### Chat-Based Graph Interaction

Users interact with the agent through a real-time **WebSocket chat interface** in the webapp. You can ask natural language questions and the agent will automatically translate them into Cypher queries against the Neo4j graph:

- *"What vulnerabilities exist on 192.168.1.100?"* — the agent generates a Cypher query, injects tenant filters (so you only see your project's data), executes it, and returns the results in natural language.
- *"Which technologies have critical CVEs?"* — traverses the Technology → CVE relationship chain.
- *"Show me all open ports on the subdomains of example.com"* — walks the Subdomain → IP → Port path.
- *"Find all endpoints with injectable parameters"* — queries Parameter nodes marked as injectable by Nuclei.

The text-to-Cypher system includes 25+ example patterns, handles the critical distinction between Vulnerability nodes (scanner findings, lowercase severity) and CVE nodes (NVD entries, uppercase severity), and automatically retries with error context if a query fails (up to 3 attempts).

#### Real-Time Control

The agent runs as a background task, keeping the WebSocket connection free for control messages:

- **Guidance** — send steering messages while the agent works (e.g., *"Focus on SSH vulnerabilities, ignore web apps"*). These are injected into the system prompt before the next reasoning step.
- **Stop** — pause execution at any point. The agent's state is checkpointed via LangGraph's MemorySaver.
- **Resume** — continue from the last checkpoint with full context preserved.
- **Approval workflows** — phase transitions to exploitation or post-exploitation pause the agent and present a structured request (reason, planned actions, risks) for the user to approve, modify, or abort.

#### MCP Tool Integration

**Agent Zero** connects to two MCP layers:

**PandaExploit MCP** (platform API + ingest):
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `set_pandaexploit_context` | Set project/user for subsequent calls |
| `list_projects`, `get_project` | Project management |
| `get_graph`, `get_vulnerabilities`, `get_evidence` | Query attack surface |
| `start_recon`, `get_recon_status`, `get_recon_logs` | Recon pipeline control |
| `ingest_nmap_output`, `ingest_nuclei_output`, `ingest_nikto_output`, `ingest_sqlmap_output`, `ingest_custom_findings` | Write tool output to graph |

**Kali Sandbox MCPs** (execute tools):
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `execute_naabu` | Port scanning |
| `execute_curl` | HTTP requests |
| `execute_nuclei` | Vulnerability scanning |
| `execute_nikto` | Web server scanning |
| `execute_sqlmap` | SQL injection testing |
| `execute_nmap` | Network scanning |
| `metasploit_console` | Exploitation |

After each `execute_*` run, Agent Zero calls the matching `ingest_*` tool so findings populate the graph. For long-running Metasploit operations, progress streams every 5 seconds via WebSocket.

---

### Attack Surface Graph

The Neo4j graph database is the **single source of truth** for every finding in PandaExploit. It stores the complete topology of the target's attack surface as an interconnected knowledge graph, enabling both visual exploration in the webapp and intelligent querying by the AI agent.

#### Node Types

The graph contains **17 node types** organized into four categories:

**Infrastructure Nodes** — represent the network topology:

| Node | Key Properties | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Domain** | name, registrar, creation_date, expiration_date, WHOIS data | Root domain with full WHOIS information |
| **Subdomain** | name, has_dns_records | Discovered hostname |
| **IP** | address, version, is_cdn, cdn_name, asn | Resolved IP address with CDN/ASN metadata |
| **Port** | number, protocol, state | Open port on an IP |
| **Service** | name, product, version, banner | Running service with version info |

**Web Application Nodes** — represent the application layer:

| **Certificate** | subject_cn, issuer, not_after, san, tls_version | TLS certificate details |
| **DNSRecord** | type (A/AAAA/MX/NS/TXT/SOA), value, ttl | DNS record for a subdomain |

**Vulnerability & Exploitation Nodes** — represent security findings and successful attacks:

| Node | Key Properties | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Vulnerability** | id, name, severity (lowercase), source (nuclei/gvm*/security_check), category, curl_command | Scanner finding with evidence (*GVM integration under development) |
| **CVE** | id, cvss, severity (uppercase), description, published | Known vulnerability from NVD |
| **MitreData** | cve_id, cwe_id, cwe_name, abstraction | CWE weakness mapping |
| **Capec** | capec_id, name, likelihood, severity, execution_flow | Common attack pattern |
| **Exploit** | attack_type, target_ip, session_id, cve_ids, metasploit_module | Agent-created successful exploitation record |

#### Relationship Chain

The graph connects these nodes through a directed relationship chain that mirrors real-world infrastructure topology:

```

Vulnerabilities connect differently depending on their source:
- **Nuclei findings** (web application) → linked via `FOUND_AT` to the specific Endpoint and `AFFECTS_PARAMETER` to the vulnerable Parameter.
- **GVM findings** (network level, *under development*) → will be linked via `HAS_VULNERABILITY` directly to the IP once GVM integration is complete.
- **Security checks** (DNS/email/headers) → linked via `HAS_VULNERABILITY` to the Subdomain or Domain.

#### How the Agent Uses the Graph

Before the agent takes any offensive action, it queries the graph to build situational awareness. This is the core intelligence loop:

1. **Attack surface mapping** — the agent queries the Domain → Subdomain → IP → Port → Service chain to understand what's exposed.
2. **Technology-CVE correlation** — traverses Technology → CVE relationships to find which detected software versions have known vulnerabilities, prioritizing by CVSS score.
3. **Injectable parameter discovery** — queries Parameter nodes flagged as `is_injectable: true` by Nuclei to identify confirmed injection points.
4. **Exploit feasibility assessment** — cross-references open ports, running services, and known CVEs to determine which Metasploit modules are likely to succeed.
5. **Post-exploitation context** — after a successful exploit, the agent creates an Exploit node linked to the target IP, CVE, and port, so subsequent queries can reference what's already been compromised.

All queries are automatically scoped to the current user and project via regex-based tenant filter injection — the agent never generates tenant filters itself, preventing accidental cross-project data access.

### Project Settings

Every project in PandaExploit has **180+ configurable parameters** that control the behavior of each reconnaissance module and the AI agent. These settings are managed through the webapp's project form UI, stored in PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM, and fetched by the recon container and agent at runtime.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/new_project.gif" alt="PandaExploit Project Settings" width="100%"/>
</p>

#### Target Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Target Domain | — | The root domain to assess |
| Subdomain List | [] | Specific subdomain prefixes to scan (empty = discover all) |
| Verify Domain Ownership | false | Require DNS TXT record proof before scanning |
| Use Tor | false | Route all recon traffic through the Tor network |
| Use Bruteforce | true | Enable Knockpy active subdomain bruteforcing |

#### Scan Module Toggles

Modules can be individually enabled/disabled with automatic dependency resolution — disabling a parent module automatically disables all children:

```
domain_discovery (root)
  └── port_scan
       └── http_probe
            ├── resource_enum
            └── vuln_scan
```

#### Port Scanner (Naabu)

Controls how ports are discovered on target hosts. Key settings include scan type (SYN vs. CONNECT), top-N port selection or custom port ranges, rate limiting, thread count, CDN exclusion, passive mode via Shodan InternetDB, and host discovery skip.

#### HTTP Prober (httpx)

Controls what metadata is extracted from live HTTP services. Over 25 toggles for individual probe types: status codes, content analysis, technology detection, TLS/certificate inspection, favicon hashing, JARM fingerprinting, ASN/CDN detection, response body inclusion, and custom header injection. Also configures redirect following depth and rate limiting.

#### Technology Detection (Wappalyzer)

Controls the second-pass technology fingerprinting engine. Settings include enable/disable toggle, minimum confidence threshold (0-100%), HTML requirement filter, auto-update from npm, and cache TTL.

#### Banner Grabbing

Controls raw socket banner extraction for non-HTTP ports (SSH, FTP, SMTP, MySQL, Redis). Settings include enable/disable toggle, connection timeout, thread count, and maximum banner length.

#### Web Crawler (Katana)

Controls active website crawling. Key settings include crawl depth (1-10), maximum URLs per domain, JavaScript rendering toggle, scope control (exact domain vs. root domain vs. subdomains), rate limiting, and exclude patterns (100+ default patterns for static assets, CDNs, and tracking pixels).

#### Passive URL Discovery (GAU)

Controls historical URL collection from web archives. Settings include provider selection (Wayback Machine, Common Crawl, OTX, URLScan.io), maximum URLs per domain, year range filtering, URL verification via httpx (with its own rate limit and thread settings), HTTP method detection via OPTIONS, dead endpoint filtering, and file extension blacklists.

#### API Discovery (Kiterunner)

Controls API endpoint brute-forcing. Settings include wordlist selection (routes-large, routes-small, apiroutes), rate limiting, connection count, status code whitelist/blacklist, minimum content length filter, and HTTP method detection mode (brute-force vs. OPTIONS).

#### Vulnerability Scanner (Nuclei)

Controls template-based vulnerability detection. Key settings include severity filtering, DAST mode toggle (active fuzzing), template inclusion/exclusion by path or tag, rate limiting, concurrency controls, Interactsh out-of-band detection toggle, headless browser rendering, redirect following, and template auto-update.

#### CVE Enrichment

Controls post-scan CVE lookup. Settings include enable/disable toggle, data source selection (NVD or Vulners), maximum CVEs per finding, minimum CVSS score filter, and API keys.

#### MITRE Mapping

Controls CWE/CAPEC enrichment of CVE findings. Settings include auto-update toggle, CWE/CAPEC inclusion toggles, and cache TTL.

#### Security Checks

25+ individual toggle-controlled checks grouped into six categories:

- **Network Exposure** — direct IP access (HTTP/HTTPS), IP-based API exposure, WAF bypass detection.
- **TLS/Certificate** — certificate expiry warning (configurable days threshold).
- **Security Headers** — missing Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, COOP, CORP, COEP, Cache-Control, CSP unsafe-inline.
- **Authentication** — login forms over HTTP, session cookies without Secure/HttpOnly flags, Basic Auth without TLS.
- **DNS Security** — missing SPF, DMARC, DNSSEC records, zone transfer enabled.
- **Exposed Services** — admin ports, databases, Redis without auth, Kubernetes API, SMTP open relay.
- **Application** — insecure form actions, missing rate limiting.

#### Agent Behavior

Controls how the AI agent operates during chat sessions:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| LLM Model | gpt-5.2 | The language model powering the agent |
| Max Iterations | 100 | Maximum reasoning-action loops per objective |
| Require Approval for Exploitation | true | Pause and ask before entering exploitation phase |
| Require Approval for Post-Exploitation | true | Pause and ask before entering post-exploitation phase |
| Activate Post-Exploitation Phase | true | Whether post-exploitation is available at all |
| Post-Exploitation Type | statefull | Meterpreter sessions (statefull) vs. one-shot commands (stateless) |
| LHOST / LPORT | — | Attacker IP and port for reverse shell payloads |
| Bind Port on Target | 4444 | Port the target opens for bind shell payloads |
| Payload Use HTTPS | false | Use HTTPS for reverse shell callbacks |
| Custom System Prompts | — | Per-phase custom instructions injected into the agent's system prompt |
| Tool Output Max Chars | 8000 | Truncation limit for tool output in context |
| Execution Trace Memory | 100 | Number of historical steps kept in the agent's working memory |
| Brute Force Max Attempts | 3 | Maximum wordlist attempts per service |

### 6. GVM Scanner

> **Status: Under Development** — GVM integration is currently being built and is not yet available in the production stack.

Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM), formerly known as OpenVAS, is an enterprise-grade network vulnerability scanner. Unlike Nuclei (which focuses on web application testing via HTTP templates), GVM performs deep network-level vulnerability assessment by probing services directly at the protocol layer — testing for misconfigurations, outdated software, default credentials, and known CVEs across every open port.

- **170,000+ Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)** — the largest open-source vulnerability test feed, covering operating systems, network services, databases, and embedded devices.
- **CVSS scoring and CVE mapping** — every finding includes a CVSS score, CVE references, and remediation guidance.
- **Recon output integration** — will consume the IP addresses and open ports discovered by the recon pipeline, eliminating the need for redundant host discovery.
- **Graph database linkage** — GVM findings will be stored as Vulnerability nodes in Neo4j, linked directly to IP nodes via `HAS_VULNERABILITY` relationships, complementing the web-layer findings from Nuclei.

### 7. Test Environments

> **Status: Under Development** — Guinea pig environments are provided as reference configurations but are not yet fully integrated into the automated pipeline.

Intentionally vulnerable Docker containers for safe, isolated testing. These environments let you validate the full PandaExploit pipeline — from reconnaissance to exploitation — without touching any external system.

| Environment | Vulnerability | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Apache 2.4.25 | CVE-2017-3167 | Authentication bypass in `mod_auth_digest`, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources |
| Apache 2.4.49 | CVE-2021-41773 (Path Traversal + RCE) | Path normalization flaw enabling directory traversal and remote code execution via `mod_cgi` |

These containers are designed to be deployed alongside the main stack so the AI agent can discover, scan, and exploit them in a controlled lab environment.
